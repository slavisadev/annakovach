# How to contribute
This repository is a curated set of snippets that show off the [AWeber API].
We welcome contributions to expand, correct, or otherwise modify our examples
as pull requests against this repository **provided that the changes meet our
standards**.  Don't let that discourage you from contributing.  This document
provides guard rails for your contributions in order for them to be as
effective as possible.

## Getting started
The first thing that you should do is fork this repository.  Your pull requests
will come from modifications in your personal fork so start by forking the
repository and then cloning your fork to your computer.  See [help.github.com]
for instructions on [creating a fork].  Assuming that you have forked, then clone
the repository using `git`.

    prompt$ git clone git@my-org:public-api-examples.git

If you don't plan on contributing back yet, you can skip the fork and simply
clone the upstream repository as well:

    prompt$ git clone https://github.com/aweber/public-api-examples.git

Now you have a local copy that you can play with.  Each of the supported
languages contain specific language-specific readmes on how to configure
the environment that they expect as well as any expectations that need to be
met for review.

## Pull request process
Once you have made changes to the project, you can [submit a pull request]
using github.  The AWeber API team tries to get to pull requests as soon as
possible but it may take us a few days to respond.  We will respond with
direct comments if there are any changes required to fit in with the overall
style of the project.  Once everything is in order, the pull request will
likely be merged.
