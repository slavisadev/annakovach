      <h2 class="mainHeading">Homely College Senior From Ohio Reveals One Secret From Astrology to Force A Libra to Chase You Down (Even If He's Cold, Mean and Unbalanced)</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Anna...</p>
      <p>And if the man you are seeing was born between September 23 and October 23 then this is going to be the most important message you'll ever see about him...</p>
      <p>And the reason is in the next 90 seconds your going to see how to attract almost any Libra man… craving with deep devotion for you and only you...</p>
      <p>... moreover, you'll also discover how to tip the scales in your favor and load him with love, lust and obsession so intense that he unleashes a beast within himself to hunt you... even fight violently to get you and chase you down...</p>
      <p>He'll never be able to let you go away... sometimes even begging you to never leave him.</p>
      <p>And by the time you <i>finish this page</i>, I wonder how soon you realize that finally you've the keys to his heart and mind...</p>
      <p>You'll discover how to make him realize that your "the one" he's been looking for all along...</p>
      <p>Finally, you can say "good bye" to all the confusions... no more putting up with his "hot and cold" nature...</p>
      <p>... no more worrying about approaching him or hoping "he'll get your signals"...</p>
      <p>... no more feeling uncertain about your future and wishing he want you in the same way as you want him...</p>
      <p>Now what I'm going to show you here is so deep and primal "experts" almost never talk about these things... See, this is not about those junk "horoscopes" or "psychological loopholes" you've been told since you were a small kid...</p>
      <p>This ancient secret was ignored, ridiculed... even buried up until now... It has never been revealed so I urge you to <i>watch this page</i> and I can promise you'll soon crack the code to a Libra's heart...</p>
      <p><b>Now I'm sure you must be wondering who the heck am I?</b></p>
      <p>And how can I claim you can read a Libra in love... everybody knows loving a Libra is such an emotional roller coaster. Heck, he could not make a decision to save his own life... how can he ever decide to chase you or want you…</p>
      <p>And let me tell you... you're absolutely right.</p>
      <p>You can't predict or manipulate a Libra.</p>
      <p>One moment he'd be shouting from the rooftops that he loves you... but the very next moment he’d be giving you the cold shoulder...</p>
      <h2>Are you beginning to realize why he is sending you mixed signals?</h2>
      <p><i>Why does this have to be so complex?</i></p>
      <p>OK let me explain it a bit and then you'll start to realize how to attract and keep him.</p>
      <p>Are you ready for this?</p>
      <p>Okay the truth is that you can't control a Libra man... ever... at least, not until you know what influences him.</p>
      <p>What I mean is even though he is a son of the Venus - the beautiful Goddess of love and romance... (Though it gives you unique challenges) but the disastrous influence on a Libra's personality can come from the Sun (and sometimes the Saturn) - a very important figure in Astrology - in a moment I'll tell you why.</p>
      <p>And because of these natural influences he can come off as cold, mean and even indifferent to you... See, it's not your mistake if he turns towards his dark side...</p>
      <p>Now here’s another twist to the story... because of the dominance of the Venus - he's a gentleman... flirtatious and sweet talker who loves attention from beautiful women.</p>
      <p>And this is the reason why only he can adore you... love you with a deep sense of worship like no other man can...</p>
      <p><b>Now I'm sure you've realized why he is sending you mixed signals...</b></p>
      <p>... getting confused about you and your sign... sometimes coming to win you even if he has to slay fierce dragons... and at other times becoming a sadist he relishes your pain.</p>
      <p><b>But here let me warn you: this is just the tip of the iceberg.</b></p>
      <p>Because the Sun is not the only one influencing him... the rabbit hole goes deep... Now before you think its way too complex, allow me to tell you a story.</p>
      <p>And pretty soon you'll realize how reading a Libra is simple.</p>
      <p>Now it's a bit embarrassing for me to acknowledge here... but not too long ago I was highly skeptical of Astrology.</p>
      <h2>And then I met "The One."</h2>
      <p>As a brilliant student of Psychology I somehow knew he belonged to me. I assumed I can "get" Frank, a hot Taurus, pretty easily.</p>
      <p>Everything was going on great and he was madly into me.</p>
      <p>He lit every cell of my body with fire and ecstasy... even bending over backwards to make me smile... and soon I was addicted to him.</p>
      <p>But then things suddenly turned south. I didn't know what happened.</p>
      <p>I couldn't stop him from hating me. Actually, the truth is I couldn't handle his imbalanced side.</p>
      <h2>And Then One Cold Day He Said "Good-Bye" Over The Phone...</h2>
      <p>I was devastated.</p>
      <p>But then it struck me that I study under some of the brightest Psychologists in the world and I can easily make Frank come running back to me... Right?</p>
      <p>Well here's what happened next...</p>
      <p>... Nothing.</p>
      <p>None of those "loopholes in male psyche" my professors boasted about worked. I went home empty handed.</p>
      <p>Finally, I saw Frank dating a damn good hottie. I had no chance in front of her...</p>
      <p><b>The witch stole my love from me...</b> and drove the final nail in the coffin.</p>
      <p>I cried for days and nights dreaming about Frank, devouring junk food like a junkie... trying Law of Attraction and what not...</p>
      <p>At that time, my mom took pity on me and suggested me to take a vacation to Romania... My family emigrated from there when I was a little girl.</p>
      <p>I wasn't excited about the vacation. But I reluctantly packed my bags and flew to Romania.</p>
      <p>My first stop was Otopeni, slightly north of Bucharest. At Vernesti, I had to meet my aunt. And then after about half an hour's drive to Soresti I was going to stay put for my vacations.</p>
      <p>The journey was pleasant and I felt a change. And unknowingly this small decision nudged the ball rolling in my favor... and I was about to witness a great secret of life.</p>
      <p>Finally, when I met my aunt I felt a huge change in my energy. I felt wonderful.</p>
      <p>And even though I was enjoying the idyllic place, my aunt confounded me by asking what was wrong with me.</p>
      <p><i>Gawd, is my break-up written all over my face?</i></p>
      <p>Anyways good for me, I told her everything about how Frank dumped me, how a witch stole him from me and how having access to some of the most modern Psychological and Technological advancement I could not do anything about it.</p>
      <p>But my aunt just smiled and nodded and said, "What sign is he?"</p>
      <p><i>What? Why? How does that make any difference?</i></p>
      <p>Anyways I told her... And soon she had an even bigger grin.</p>
      <p><i>Is she making fun of me?</i> I thought.</p>
      <p>And then something happened which scared the living daylights out me.</p>
      <p>She blurted out a few details about Frank and me.</p>
      <p>Then like a good Psychologist I reasoned... it doesn't prove anything. Anyone can get a few details right about any guy. Right?</p>
      <p>Actually, my aunt was an ace Astrologer. You see, Astrology is big in Romania. Television, newspapers and radio spots are filled with ads from psychics, astrologers and oracles.</p>
      <p>Finally, when we reached home (which was more like a castle) I realized she is doing pretty well in her vocation. Her customers included top honchos, big politicians, and celebs flying in from around the world.</p>
      <p>When we settled down for refreshments, a part of me was feeling like my life was about to change soon...</p>
      <p>And then she carefully prepared something called a 'Synastry report' and my eyes opened wide with amazement as I read it. If I'd access to this report earlier our relationship would have been firing on all cylinders.</p>
      <p>I had never seen anything like this ever.</p>
      <p>The report was like a deep psychological analysis - yet giving you a bird's eye view of the relationship.</p>
      <p>I gulped hard and realized why Frank dumped me... why there was a chasm between us... and why deep down in his heart he was upset with me.</p>
      <p>I finally "got" Frank. I wish I had visited her earlier.</p>
      <p><b>"But it's too late now..."</b> I said.</p>
      <p>And then my aunt looked in my eyes and said, <b>"Do you really believe that? What are the odds any other woman can read Frank like you do now?"</b></p>
      <p>I felt a jolt and saw a glimmer of hope flickering in the darkest hour of night. But I must decide now and reach out to grab him...</p>
      <p>Naturally I still had some doubts about all this. So I did a bit more research, reading rare books in my aunt's library.</p>
      <p>I realized why Astrology is a much deeper science than those junk horoscopes you read in magazines and newspapers.</p>
      <p>See Astrology is not about what's going to happen... it's always about what can happen especially when you change your course - tapping into the powerful forces of the nature.</p>
      <p>Of course, you know the phenomenon of the tides. The sun and the moon, sitting millions of miles away from the earth, move HUNDEREDS OF BILLIONS OF TONS OF WATER so effortlessly!</p>
      <p>And you know our bodies have 70% water. Imagine how much influence they can put on your moods, decisions and lives.</p>
      <p>The truth is Astrology has always attracted the intelligent and logical people. In a study conducted in the 1960s, Astrologers beat Psychologists hands down when it came to predicting case histories.</p>
      <h2>What do famous scientists like Galileo, Albert Einstein, Carl Jung, and Johannes Kepler etc. have in common?</h2>
      <p>These scientists believed in Astrology.</p>
      <p>In fact, recently it came to light that the wife of the US President Ronald Reagan relied upon Astrology to guide her husband in the White House to great successes... President Reagan started to rely upon her advice AFTER the Iran-Contra fiasco in the mid-1980s.</p>
      <p>Remember, it was Reagan, one of America's most famous presidents, who ended the cold war without firing a single bullet.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that from the White house to the Wall Street... from relationships to multi-million dollar business decisions... Astrology is a widely consulted science.</p>
      <p>It was no more smoke and mirrors.</p>
      <p>It opened my eyes… as a Gemini woman I was incompatible with Frank in more ways than I thought. I crawled into his mind and read him like a book.</p>
      <p><b>And now I was getting impatient to test my new weapon. Why not?</b></p>
      <p>So I flew out to WIN my Frank back. There was no room for misfires or duds.</p>
      <p>Next day I called him without any fuss... it didn't matter whether he was smooching that hottie or schmoozing some million-dollar client...</p>
      <p>He instantly picked up the phone and surprisingly asked me where I had been. Of course, I stuck to what my aunt had told me.</p>
      <p>And then we talked for over an hour. No pleading, no emotional blackmailing, no smoke and mirror techniques.</p>
      <p>By the time, we finished an incredible thing happened. Frank wondered if we could meet in the evening. I felt as if I’ve staked claim to his heart...</p>
      <p>And then he said, "Oh honey, meet me whenever you want..." He turned down all of his million-dollar clients just to see me. Now that had never happened before.</p>
      <p>When we met, initially I was terrified... I kept in mind the roadmap my aunt showed me.</p>
      <p>Amazingly by the time we finished he was feeling guilty for breaking up with me and he wanted to come back.</p>
      <p>I didn't know how to handle it.</p>
      <p>Long story short, he darted back like a lost dog to its rightful owner and I realized the power of Astrology.</p>
      <p>Over the next few years, I delved deeper into this ancient science. And soon I started helping out others in the matters of love and it became my profession.</p>
      <p>Now an obvious question you may have is what happened to our relationship after all these years.</p>
      <p>Well, our love grew deeper... <b>And after almost two years - he went down on his knees and proposed to me.</b></p>
      <p>It couldn't have happened without my aunt, Astrology and the roadmap she gave me. I cried but it was the best thing that happened with me.</p>
      <h2>Now It's Your Turn to Steal A Libra's Heart</h2>
      <p>Imagine his mind as a maze and locked at the center is his heart. Also in the room are bottomless pits, hostile women and dangerous beasts...</p>
      <p>Thing is even if you could fly through some “loophole”... you could never manipulate or beat the beast into submission. Because the fiery "Solar flares" can strike you and fry you like a chip.</p>
      <p>But what if you've a perfect roadmap with written instructions showing you which place to avoid, which to visit and how to handle his dark side to steal his heart easily?</p>
      <p>Of course, consultation with a good relationship Astrologer is your best bet.</p>
      <p>But it's impossible for me to guide everyone. And many women might not be able to afford my regular fees let alone my private visiting fees. It was disheartening for me.</p>
      <p>A fantastic idea struck me. First I got scared... but then I was given the faith to pursue it.</p>
      <p>This is going to blow your mind away.</p>
      <h2>Introducing "Libra Man Secrets"</h2>
      <img class="bookCover" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/img/book-cover.png" alt="<?php echo HORO_NAMESPACE_CAP ?> Man Secrets">

      <p>Here's why I'm excited: I'd a jealously-guarded easy-to-follow guide I used to share with my loyal clients only. It was privately called "Libra Man Secrets." Some friends even recommended to never publish it.</p>
      <p>But a word got leaked and soon my inbox got flooded with pleas for help and women begging to be let in. And frankly, I was a bit worried...</p>
      <p>You see, this guide gives women tremendous power over Libra men...</p>
      <p>Here I've poured the Libra man so he is attracted to you with uncontrolled instincts; you'll fly under the radar and make it HIS idea to chase you - with obsession.</p>
      <p>So I can share it with you only if you qualify 3 simple terms:</p>
      <p>First, you must NEVER misuse your new powers - not even for fun,</p>
      <p>Second, you must NEVER attract a committed Libra man - again - not even for fun,</p>
      <p>Third, you must NEVER control a Libra man against his will.</p>
      <p><b>Now I invite you to try this "secret weapon" yourself.</b></p>
      <p>Libra Man Secrets gives you a "roadmap" to ignite his devotion for you.</p>
      <p>It's a perfect blend of Astrology, Psychology and something called Sextrology.</p>
      <p>And it works like clockwork on almost every Libra man out there... even if he has rejected you a hundred times, or he's a compulsive cheater or he's a "commitment phobic" man.</p>

        <li>A Libra is a hopeless-romantic... which means most of the times he has already lost his "hope"... It also means that he has a very fragile ego and can be surprisingly stubborn in love. If he senses things are NOT going the way he wants them to be... he can become mean, stiff even rude. <b>I'll show you one simple technique to weave a web of "fantasy" so he feels like he's part of a fairy-tale and he must never let go of you...</b></li>

        <li>Cross the enemy line and learn exactly how a Libra man thinks about broken relationships, especially with a woman of your sign. The candid, honest and most brutal truth he can't tell you... like why he'd shut a smart woman out of his life or pull away without any cause... why he'd cheat on the love of his life... You might be shocked to learn but many Libra men feel they were "pushed away" by their women...</li>
        <li>And so much more...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The bottom line is: Libra Man Secrets is designed to guide you at every stage of your relationship.</p>
      <p>Now that we've taken care of your relationship, next comes one of the most important part of his life...</p>
      <p>... one he'll never reveal it to you for fear of being judged - his sexual needs. Sometimes you might ignore these needs for fear of crossing the line and hurting him... and you'll be right to do so.</p>
      <p><b>But how do you stir his tremendous sexual and creative energies and create sparks of love and life so essential for a successful relationship with a Libra?</b></p>
      <p>The good news is you don't have to figure it out all by yourself because I've deciphered the code for you...</p>
